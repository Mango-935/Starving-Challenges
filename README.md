# Starving-Challenges
A rip-off of the hunger games as an in-depth simulator.

This project is a just a fun little game/simulator that is meant to be a play on the hunger games. My hope is that it runs similarly to the hunger games, but also with some unique changes as well. I decided on doing this as a website because it is easier to get access to it from multiple machines with several users on it when compared to traditional programs using languages such as C++ and Java.
